# Discover Ghibli
A responsive web app which helps new fans discover the full breadth of Studio Ghibli's incredible film catalog. Sure, everybody's seen Spirited Away, but have you ever heard of Porco Rosso, or Pom Poko?

[Try it out here](https://ramblingadam.github.io/ghibli-browser/)!

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ghibli API

This app uses the Ghibli REST API, arranging, formatting, and displaying a bevy of data in a simple, pleasant interface.

Just try to tell me those buttons aren't satisfying. I dare you.
